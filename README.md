sf-circle extension provides support scripts to use Circle CI (or
similar external CI service) to execute full-scale CI/CD processes
(note that all application-side code is not open sourced for now).

If you're looking for something more simple, you can also look at
sf-app-deploy extension, which is a minimalistic, and fully open
sourced approach to CI/CD processes.
